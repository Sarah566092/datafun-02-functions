2023-05-16 20:17:52,042 Correlation requires Python version 3.10 or greater.
2023-05-16 20:17:52,042 Your version is 3.11
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043 Here's some data on hot dog sales depending on how many condiments are availble on a food truck:
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043 Number of condiments today:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043 Hot Dog Sales today:[5, 11, 14, 19, 25, 31, 37, 39, 44, 49, 55, 63, 69]
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043 correlation between condiments and condiments = 1.00
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043 correlation between condiments and hot dog sales = 1.00
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043 Here's some bivariant data (2 variables, together):
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043 x:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043 y:[5, 11, 14, 19, 25, 31, 37, 39, 44, 49, 55, 63, 69]
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043 Calculate the slope and intercept of a best fit straight line:
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043    slope = 5.19
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043    intercept = -0.85
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043 Let's use our best fit line to PREDICT a future value.
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043    If we provide 15 condiments on the food truck = 15,
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043    we predict the value of hot dog sales will be 77.
2023-05-16 20:17:52,043 15 condiments is a lot!!!
